<p>Now, since you clicked the link to this page, I need to show some good decks used in ledgendary arena. These decks bellow are decks I am using in ledgendary arena. Feel free to use it, or modify it so it fits your style. These decks are decks in the 1.70 version.</p>

<p>Do you think im crazy showing you guys a trolly x-bow deck in the begening of this post? Well, first of all, this deck is not a troll deck, it is a push deck. Second, I am actually a siege player.(My next deck archtype I like is beatdown decks), and lastly, this deck is AMAZING. You could try this deck if you are tired of playing the Hog Rider, Giant, and Golem decks. So lets go to the explanation.</p>
</center>
<center><div class="header">Card explanition</div></center>
<p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>X-bow</strong>: This is your deck’s win condition. As with all X-Bow Decks, only play it when you are ahead in elixir because using it at the wrong time could cost you the game.</li>
<li><strong>Log/Zap and Fireball/Rocket</strong>: These are the two spells in the deck, great for defending big pushes, killing support troops, protecting the X-Bow and more.</li>
<li><strong>Skeleton Army/Inferno Tower</strong>: These two cards are your primary tank killers. If they zap one of them then you have the other card to cover for it. These two cards are also very good for protecting the X-Bow.</li>
<li><strong>The other Cards</strong>: These are the deck’s support cards, they are very good cards that can be used in tons of situations.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<center><div class="header">X-bow placement</div></center>
<center>
<p><img src="images/x-bow-placements.jpg" width="600"></p>
<p>This is how you place your x-bow. This is optimal for a few reasons.</p>
</center>
<p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Firstly, this allows you to place the inferno tower beside the X-bow and river, so any troops that try and target your X-bow must first go through the Inferno.</li>
<li>Secondly, allowing one tile of space means that your crown tower will be able to shoot some troops that are targeting your X-Bow (“some troops” because it depends on the range). Naturally one extra tile also allows more time before troops can reach your X-Bow , and makes it much easier to defend.</li>
</ul>
<center><div class="header">Strategy and gameplan</div></center>
</p>
<p>Never play your X-Bow until you have secured an elixir advantage/strong counter push. What I mean by strong counter push is that even though you might be at the same amount of elixir as your opponent, you could still have more troops in play, which technically means you are ahead.</p>

<p>Generally, you never want to play your X-Bow on its own. Make sure you have a Mega Minion or Ice Golem coming up behind it before you play it.</p>

<p>The Deck’s main defense against tanks is the inferno tower. A lot of times your opponent will play a zap to reset the inferno, allowing your skarmy to be played. Against a lone hog try and play megaminion and ice spirit if you can, because playing the inferno will mean that you will lose 1 elixir.</p>

<p>The X-Bow is mainly a 1 crown win deck. Get a second crown when it is a 1 vs 1 match or when you have a chance to get the second one.</p>

<p>A tip that people rarely give, is to try and play the X-Bow on the same side that your opponent is pushing on. Not only does it allow for easier counter pushing, there’s also another reason. Imagine you and your opponent traded towers on different sides i.e. my left tower and his left tower. This almost means that you will never be able to take your opponents second crown tower. Because there is so much space, your opponent can now directly spawn troops ON TOP of the X-Bow, making it very difficult to defend it.</p>

<p>When you are winning by 1 tower and there’s less than 1 minute left it is often a good choice to play the X-Bow in in the middle for defense! I call that turtling. The X-Bow has so much health and it’s range can kill troops at a distance, so it can definitely be a good idea!</p>

<center><div class="header">Direct counters to the X-bow</div></center>
<p><span class="bigbadbold">Giant</span></p>
<p>This bad boy has lots of HP, a Giant can definitely tank X-Bow shots and kill the X-Bow. There’s a couple of different ways you can approach it.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>The first thing you can try is placing the Inferno above the X-bow, with the placement I mentioned earlier. This means the Giant has to target the Inferno first, allowing your inferno to kill it. This can be risky as your opponent could place Minions etc. to distract the Inferno.</li>
<li>Another option is to use Skeleton Army in front of the X-Bow to quickly take out the Giant, of course it won’t work if they have troops backing the Giant or Zap/Log.</li>
<li>However, the Giant is probably your opponents win condition, so maybe play defense until they use the Giant, then counter push immediately with the X-Bow while they don’t have the giant in cycle. That is probably the safest way to play.</li>
<li>Otherwise, if you can’t win then play for a draw.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bigbadbold">Hog</span></p>
<p>Same as above</p>

<p><span class="bigbadbold">Royal Giant</span></p>
<p>Similar to the giant but its range is too big for you to counter with Inferno or Skeleton Army, so I guess waiting for your opponent to use it on offense is your best bet.</p>

<p><span class="bigbadbold">Baloon</span></p>
<p>It is very hard to stop a Balloon, the Inferno placed above the tower can attract the Balloon, use combinations like Mega Minion and Ice Spirit to take it out.</p>

<p><span class="bigbadbold">Elite Barbarians</span></p>
<p>One of the reasons the X-Bow’s popularity has decreased is because of this very strong and fast card, that can shred the X-Bow very quickly.</p>

<ul class="bullet">
<li>If they have no Zap or Log in rotation, I would definitely suggest to use Skeleton Army to counter them pretty easily and protect the X-Bow.</li>
<li>If not, then use the Ice Golem/Mega Minion/Ice Spirit/Log for some good combos that will probably be able to mitigate most of the damage, even Fireball them if you have to.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bigbadbold">Rocket/lightning</span></p>
<p>The worst counter to meet in the game. All the opponent have to do is place a small tank to soak up a few X-Bow shots then Rocket. The only way to beat this is to out cycle their X-Bow, which is pretty difficult if you are playing someone good. So if matched up against Rocket you pretty much have to play for a draw.</p>
