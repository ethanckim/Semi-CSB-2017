<p>This is my second best deck (This is my opinion) that I use on tournaments and chalanges. What the image is showing is a control deck, but I modified it a little by adding the giant and some support troups, creating a beatdown deck.</p>

<center><div class="header">Card explanations</div></center>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Graveyard</strong>:Your primary win condition. You will want to play it only when you have a unit tanking the tower, usually giant or ice golem. Make sure you have an Elixir advantage when playing this card, as a misplay with this card will put you way behind on Elixir.</li>
<li><strong>Poison</strong>:Counters Archers, Skeleton Army, Minion Horde, damages Mega Minion; all of the counters to your Graveyard. Since Poison lasts as long as the Graveyard, the troops will stay inside of the Poison long enough to get your full value. Poison will also do more damage than Fireball which may be the difference between win or loss if both players are spell cycling. If you know the general area in which they place their Graveyard counter, drop your Poison there. This move is a lot safer than trying to predict a Fireball. In an emergency, you can use the Poison to counter Graveyard.</li>
<li><strong>Zap</strong>:Your spell to quickly take out any delicate troops and to retarget units. Using it on top of poison durring a graveyard poison push will destroy the defending archers faster. The retarget ability also is extremely useful.</li>
</ul>

<center><div class="header">General game plan</div></center>
<p>In the beatdown deck I made, the main pitfall of people who play this deck is they overextend on their pushes, mainly with the Graveyard. Sometimes, there are extremely tempting times where you could Poison for good value. For example, they place their minions next to their Elixir collector. If it is in double Elixir time, definitely play the Poison; you need all the chip damage you can get. If it is in single Elixir time, be extremely careful. Bowler is your main defensive tool, but it cost a lot of Elixir. So if you overextend, it may cost you the tower.</p>

<span class="bigbadbold">beatdown type play</span>
<p>You have lots of aggressive cards that can be combined so that you always have an offense in your hand. Constantly pressure your opponent with pushes, and then occasionally build up your ideal push of Giant, Graveyard, Poison, and Zap. As I explained earlier, do not overextend with this deck. Aggressive and reckless have a fine line between them. So yes, you will want to constantly be attacking your opponent, but that doesn’t mean you have to make unnecessary risky plays. Once you know your opponent’s counter you can start throwing in the prediction Poison. This is most apparently effective against Skeleton Army, Minions, Archers, goblins and Minion horde, and does a lot of tower damage.</p>

<span class="bigbadbold">Control type play</span>
<p>If your opponent can constantly defend your pushes, you might want to use this style. You have a lot of defensive capabilities with the Bowler, Archers, Mega Minion, and Ice spirit. As well, you have Poison and Graveyard for guaranteed damage. Play it safe. Defend against your opponent, and then use the remaining troops to tank for a Poison and possibly a Poison.</p>

<span class="bigbadbold">Defence</span>
<p>The inferno tower is good at destroying tanks for sure. Just make sure it doesn't get out of cycle or get destroyed easily by the support units.</p>
<p>Many players will fireball your Archers so make sure that you spread them out from your other troops and even put them at a distance from your tower if it’s practical. If playing against Graveyard, your opponent will definitely use a spell to take out your Archers. Because of this, you will have to use Mega Minion, Skeletons and a well-timed Log to prevent damage. If it’s seriously tough then it might be a good idea to actually save your Poison spell for defense against the Graveyard.</p>
<p>Keep your defense flexible and see what works. There are too many defensive combos for me to explain, so you have to get a feel for what will work depending on how much your opponent spent on the push.</p>

<center><div class="header">Matchups</div></center>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><strong>Graveyard</strong>:Always keep Archers or minions in hand and use spell when necessary. Posion is a great counter for graveyard too, but only use it in emergency because it is more of an offensive tool.</li>
<li><strong>Lava Hound</strong>:You have lots of air targeting units so you will always have units to take out the Lava Hound and supporting units. Generally, a Mega Minion Ice Golem combo will take care of any supporting troops.</li>
<li><strong>Hogs</strong>:Bowler and inferno tower can counter hogs. Minions and ice spirit can counter it too. When defending against a Hog Rider, make sure you always have a solid counterpush. If not, don’t attack. Save the Elixir advantage you got from defense.
<li><strong>Royal Giants</strong>: Inferno, duh. Use the ice spirit or zap to change the aggro if the royal giant starts hitting the tower.
<li><strong>Golem/Giant</strong>: Inferno tower shreds tanks. Use your support troops to kill the support troops and counterpush.pushing when the opponent drops a golem is also a good idea, since the opponent has no elixer.
