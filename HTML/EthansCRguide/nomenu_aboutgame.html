    <p>
    When you enter a battle, you play your troops by draggin it from your hand to your territory. Troops attack and damage opponent troops, buildings and towers. Spell cards can be used anywhere, and affects opponent troops, buildings, and towers. When you place building cards, Building stay in your territory, supporting you in the game. To play these cards, you need to spend a specific amount of elixer. Elixer auto generates each 2.8 seconds, and this becomes double when there is only one minute left in the game. When you make a  tower's health 0 with your troops or spell (or building, if you use the x-bow or motor), you get 1 crown, and expand your territory. the winner is the one who gets more crowns after three minutes. If it is a tie, there is a sudden death, and whoever gets the next crown wins.

    <div class="header">Clans</div>
    <p> When you join a clan, you can friendly battle with your clanmates, donate cards to other people, and contribute for the clan chest. When you donate cards to other people, you lose some spare cards, but you earn money and user exp. Collect user exp to level up your user level, which is important because high user levels give high attack and hp for the king and arena towers when battling. The clan chest is like a crown chest, but everyone in the clan contributes. Earn enough crowns to raise the tier of the clan chest, and earn more rewards.
