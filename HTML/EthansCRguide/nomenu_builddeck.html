<h2>How to build a deck</h2>
<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->
<p> We start with this question: How do I build a well ballance deck? Building a well balanced Clash Royale deck is always the key for success in Clash Royale. I am going to show you the slot method, which will be the easyest way to build a structure deck in my opinion.</p>

	<tr>
		<td>Slot 1</td>
        <td>Main Win condition</td>
        <td>Each deck has 1 singular card that characterizes how the deck is played and what its win condition is. That’s the card in this slot. The play maker. The tower taker. The rage-quit inducer. This is the center of your deck, and it determines which archetype your deck fits into.</td>
        <td>Giant, Hog, RG, PEKKA, Golem, Miner, Elite Barbs, Prince, Lavahound, Balloon, Barbarian Hut, X-bow</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 2</td>
        <td>Win condition #2</td>
        <td>This slot is the secondary win condition card. This card supports the main pusher in such a way that the win condition is enabled. When you think about the main push of your deck, this is the card that you’ll put down with your main dynamic card.</td>
        <td>Sparky, 3 musketeers, Balloon, Hog, Dark Prince, Goblin Hut, Mortar
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 3</td>
        <td>Win condition support</td>
        <td>This slot is win-condition push support. When you are going on full offense, you’ll drop down this card to get your push to the tower. It doesn’t always have to be a troop — sometimes it is a spell. You’ll see a lot of splash damage in this slot, as it clears out cheap units that can take out tanks quickly. You’ll also see high DPS troops who’s goal is to get damage on the tower.</td>
        <td>spell, Bomber, Princess, Fire Spirits, Musketeer, Mini Pekka, Wizard, Knight</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 4</td>
        <td>Main defence</td>
        <td>This is the first of 2 defensive slots. You’ll use this card to handle enemy pushes and minimize damage on your tower. This is the main “wall” that enemy pushes will run into.</td>
        <td>Mini Pekka, Furnace, Defensive buildings, Tombstone, Minion Horde, Valkyrie, Skeleton Army</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 5</td>
        <td>Defence support</td>
        <td>This is the second defensive slot. These cards will support the action of your main defensive card to stop pushes faster. Your options aren’t just limited to these cards; most decks also pick from the list above for this second defensive slot. This slot can also be used for an Elixir Collector. It doesn’t help on defense, per say, other than providing extra elixir to stop pushes with.</td>
        <td>Ice Wizard, Ice Spirit, Baby Dragon, Elixir Collector</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 6</td>
        <td>The runner</td>
        <td>This is The Runner. This slot is both offense and defense: you can start this card on defense to stop a push and transition it easily into an offensive push. They’re efficient, and you can use them solely for offense or defense if necessary.</td>
        <td>Musketeer, Mini Pekka, Princess, Ice Wizard, Furnace and Spawner Huts, Bowler, Guards, Witch, Valkyrie, Lumberjack</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 7</td>
        <td>Quick Drop</td>
        <td>This is the versatile response card slot. These cards are there for when you are caught off guard and don’t have a good defensive card to play. You can drop any of these cards to distract/counter big pushes while you cycle to a good defensive card. On the other hand, you can also drop these guys behind a big push. If you have the extra elixir, they can support your main push and make it even more powerful. You want to pick these guys carefully because you want to be able to play them anytime and get maximum value from them. If they don’t target air, you may be caught off guard during an air attack—so you’ll want air-targeting defensive cards or an air-targeting Runner.</td>
        <td>Spear Goblins, Goblins, Archers, Minions, Skeletons, ice spirit, ice golem
   </tr>
   <tr>
		<td>Slot 8</td>
        <td>Spell</td>
        <td>This last slot is the spell slot. Spells are really important in decks, boosting and supporting defence and offence. This is the slot where you can put your spell. I know Goblin Barrel is a spell, but I did not listed it because it functions more as a offence tool and a versatile response than a true spell.</td>
        <td>Arrows, Fireball, Mirror, Rage, Freeze, Zap, Lightning, Poison, Rocket</td>
   </tr>

	Remember that you need to concern these issues...
</p>
<div class="header">Avarage Elixer Cost</div>
<p>The Average Elixir Cost is very important. You don’t want to wait 10 seconds in order to drop Card, right? <span class="bigbadbold">The ‘Average Elixir Cost’ should be between 3.5 and 4.5</span> If your AEC is higher than this, you are always struggling to constantly deploy your cards (for defending of course). If your AEC is below 3.5, although you can deploy many cards quickly but they are all low HP troops and can be wiped out by splash-damaging threats quickly. A small note here for you: If your Average Elixir Cost is above 4, you will probably want to place the Elixir Collector into your deck.</p>
<div class="header">Synergy</div>
<p>Every time we talk about deck building in this game, synergy is the most remarkable ingredient. We all want every card to work alongside each othere, right? Unfortunately If you are using ledgendary cards solely, they can’t be an excellent Deck in Clash Royale. Building a deck is not about rarity. It is about Synergy! One examples is tornado executioner: the tornado bring troops in one spot and the executioner slices them all. There is also goblin barrel miner: The miner tanks while the goblins shred the tower.</p>
<div class="header">What cards do I need in my deck?</div>
<ol class="numbers">
<li><span class="bigbadbold">Having at least 2 point damage-inflicting Cards</span></li>
<p>Although groups of low HP units can quickly destroy high HP cards and buildings, they can be eradicated by splash damaging Cards. Because of that, you always need to have at least 2 point damage-inflicting Cards as the backup.</p>
<li><span class="bigbadbold">Having at least 3 splash damage-inflicting Cards</span></li>
<p>Splash damage-inflicting Cards are important for dealing with large hordes of troops</p>
<li><span class="bigbadbold">Having at least 2 high HP cards</span></li>
<p>High HP cards can be either a troop or defense with at least 1000 HP. They are necessary to take damage and protect backup troops</p>
<li><span class="bigbadbold">Having at least 2 air-targeting Cards</span></li>
<p>If you are at a high level Arena, you usually can face aerial attackers. Make sure that there are at least 2 air-targeting Cards on your Desk.</p>
<li><span class="bigbadbold">Having at least 1 Spell Card that deals splash damage</span></li>
<p>Yes, splash damaging troops can deal with a large group of troops but their coverage, range and movement speed are limited. It is extremely important to have a splash-damaging Spell Card such as Lightning, Arrows, Rocket, Fireball or Zap. For example, your Bomber can deal splash damage from behind your Giant but If the opponent deploys a Goblin Barrels onto your Weakened Tower, a card like Arrows is very important in this situation to quickly remove those Goblins. Damage-inflicting spell cards are also very useful for taking down weakened Towers.</p>
<li><span class="bigbadbold">Having at least 1 defensive structure Card</span></li>
<p>Tombstone, Goblin Hut, Hidden Tesla, Bomb Tower, Cannon, X-Bow and Mortar are excellent for slowing down the speed of the game, give you more time to load up Elixir. Having at least 1 defensive building to protect your Towers is important because you only need to destroy 1 enemy Crown Tower to win the Battle.</p>
