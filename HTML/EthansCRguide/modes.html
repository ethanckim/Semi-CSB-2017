<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="content" -->
<p>There are 3 game modes in clash royal, and I will explain all of them.</p>
<center><img src="images/tournament.jpg" width="500"></center>
<div class="header">Ladder</div>
<p>ladder is important and easy in the beganing, but becomes hard and unfair when you keep going up arenas. To join a ladder game, Press the battle button in the main screen. This original game mode is important to collect chests, trophies, and extra gold. Chests are needed to upgrade cards, and getting spare card are worth it because you need to donate to other clanmates. Trophies are needed to rise arenas. Rise arenas to earn more battle gold, cards inside chests, donation capiaty, and new cards. The game might be unfair because the card levels and the king level you have will effect the king's health and your troops stats. Also, earning crowns in this game mode will make you contribute to the clan chest, and the crown chest.</p>
<div class="header">Custom Tournaments</div>
<p>This game mode will make each player fair by putting a cap for levels. The tournament standard caps the king level to 9, all common cards to 9, rare cards to 7, epic cards to 4, and ledgendaries to 1. Gems are needed to creat a tournament. The larger the size, the higher the cost, and higher the rewards. To join a tournament, type the name in the search bar, click the tournament you want to join, and type in the password. If you join the tournament successfully, (Tournaments fill up quickly) You can battle with other players in the tournament for 1 hour after the 2 hour prep time. By battling with people, you earn tournament trophies, which makes you go up the leaderboard. Of course you lose trophies when you lose a battle. At the end of the tournament, you earn a tournament chest according to which place you are in. The more players in the tournament, the more bigger the reward is. A 1st place 1000 player tournament chest is better than a super magical chest!</p>
<div class="header">Classic/Grand Chalenges</div>
<p>To enter a classic or grand chalange, you need to pay gems. 10 for classic, and 100 for grand. Classic chalanges give you less rewards than grand challanges. Anyways, when you enter the chalenge, you can battle with the tournament standard. When you win a battle, you can earn more rewards in the end of the chalenge. The chalenge ends when you get 12 wins, or when you get 3 loses. Whichever happens, your out. When you are out of the chalenge, you can immediatly open a tournament chest. 12 wins grand chalange chest is better than a super magical chest!</p>
<div class="header">Special Chalenges</div>
<span class="bigbadbold">Double elixer Chalenges</span>
<p>Double elixer all the time. In 1 minute before the game ends, it will still be double elixer, not X4 elixer. Chalenge rules apply. Tournament standard rules apply. May be splited to grand and classic.</p>
<span class="bigbadbold">Draft Chalenges</span>
<p>In the beganing of the match you can chose which card you will like to use. There may be a card that you have not collected yet. The card you have not chosen will go to the opponent's deck. So your opponent and you choose 4 cards, and the 4 cards that were not chosen goes to your opponent hand, creating a deck of 8 cards. Tournament standard and Chalange rules apply. Remember, your opponent know 4 of your cards, and you know 4 of your opponent's cards! May be splited to grand and classic.</p>
<span class="bigbadbold">New card Chalenges</span>
<p>The electro wizard chalange and the battle ram chalange was some examples of this chalanges. You need to build a deck with a specific card inside your deck. That card MUST be in your deck. You can use cards you have not collected yet. Tournament and Chalange rules apply. When you win a specific amount of times, then you can get the card that you needed to must use in the chalange.</p>
